I embarked on my journey in web development in August 2023 through The Odin Project, successfully completing the entire curriculum. My tech stack includes Ruby on Rails and React.js, and I'm eager to apply my skills in a professional setting. While I may not have formal experience yet, my dedication and hands-on training have prepared me to contribute effectively to any team. In my free time, I enjoy music and staying active through workouts. I'm excited to explore new opportunities where I can grow and make a meaningful impact."/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="logo192.png"/><link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json"/><meta property="twitter:image" content="/social-image.png"/><meta property="og:image" content="/social-image.png"/><title>Odilson Dev | FullStack Developer</title><script defer="defer" src="/static/js/main.8fe10ebd.js"></script><link href="/static/css/main.a2671215.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
